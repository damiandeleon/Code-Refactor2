# Code-Refactor
The purpose of this project was to improve upon the Horiseon client website page by correcting errors within the code.  

## Semantic Correction
The HTML file needed to be updated so that the tags were semantic/relevant to their pupose within the code.  Eliminating the div tags and replacing them with tags that explained what the code within was doing helps the reader understand the purpose of the code.  This helps future coders make quicker decisions on how to improve upon the code.

## Accessibility
Code needs to be accessible for the visually impaired and other users who do not rely on the visuals of a webpage.  By incorporating alt text and relevant titles (such as updating the title tag)  the HTML page helps those readers understand the content.  These updates also help make the webpage more searchable which draws more viewers to the client's website.  This also helps future coders know what image is represented in the code without having to run the page in a browser.

## General HTML corrections
Other corrections made were syntax errors in the code which corrected the functionality of the code.
